Layering of react application

# CDN 
- Content Delivery Network : which is a network of servers that  distribute web content to users based on their location.

# Parcel
- Dev build
- Server 
- Hot Module ReplacementÂ (or HMR) is one of the most useful features offered by webpack
- Caching faster build
- File watching algorithms 
- Image Optimization
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compress
- Consitent hashing
- code splitting 
- Differential bundling - support older browsers
- Error Handling
- HTTPs
- Tree Shaking - It's a process that removes unused modules,     functions, and variables from your JavaScript code during the build process.
It relies on the static structure of ES modules (import and export) to determine which parts of your code are actually used.
- Diagnostic
- Transpiles code to understand JS Engine(Browsers) -> Parcel gives responsibility to Babel for this job

# React createElement 
- React.createElement ={code}> React Element JS Object ={ReactDom}> HTMLElement(render)

# JSX 
- Javascript syntax extension which allows developer to write html-like or xml-like code in Javascript files.
- JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement JS Object => HTMLElement(render)
- This conversion is done by Babel
- Attribute should be in camelCase format.
- We can write any javascript code inside JSX using { 'curly braces' } 
- Takes care of cross site scripting attack

# Functional Component
- JavaScript Function which takes props as arguments and returns JSX code
- Component Composition - Using child component in parent component is called component composition

# Config Driven UI
- UI is based on configuration like specific location, specific users.
- It is a user Interface that is built and configured using a
declaration configuration file or data structure, rather than
being hardcoded.
- Config is the data coming from the api which keeps on changing
according to different factors like user, location, etc.

# OptionChaining 
- resData?

# Props
- Data passed as an argument to Component
- Passing the Arguments from component to component is called as Props Passing
